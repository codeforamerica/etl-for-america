ETL for America
===============

A convening place for ETL, data integration, and "plumbing the pipes" of government data

## How to get started and contribute

For this v0.1 alpha, there are two ways to engage:

### > [The Wiki](https://github.com/daguar/etl-for-america/wiki): resources and links

Use the wiki to view and share resources (tutorials, tools, code examples, blog posts, books, etc.)

### > [Issues](https://github.com/daguar/etl-for-america/issues): discussion and ideas

Use Issues for general discussions (everything is okay!) as well as ideas for projects


## What is this?

I recently wrote up a short blog post entitled ["ETL for America"](http://daguar.github.io/2014/03/17/etl-for-america/) calling out the need for more talking, code, and collaboration around the dirty work of dealing with government data.

It seems to have resonated, and my e-mail doesn't scale. I set up this GitHub repo to facilitate open communication and resource-sharing on this topic, and connect the many interested people together.
