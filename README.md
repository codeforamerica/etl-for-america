ETL for America
===============

A convening place for ETL, data integration, and "plumbing the pipes" of government data

## What is this?

I (@daguar) recently wrote up a short blog post entitled ["ETL for America"](http://daguar.github.io/2014/03/17/etl-for-america/) in which I call out the need for more talking, code, and collaboration around the dirty work of dealing with government data.

It seems to have struck a chord, and my e-mail doesn't scale for convening people. So I set up this GitHub repo with the aim of facilitating open communication and resource-sharing on this topic, as well as connect the many folks who've expressed an interest.

## How to get started and contribute

For this v0.1 alpha, there are two ways to engage:

- [The Wiki](https://github.com/daguar/etl-for-america/wiki): resources and links

  - Use the wiki to view and share resources (tutorials, tools, code examples, blog posts, books, etc.)

- [Issues](https://github.com/daguar/etl-for-america/issues): discussion and ideas

  - Use Issues for general discussions (everything is okay!) as well as ideas for projects
